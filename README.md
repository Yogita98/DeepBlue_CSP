Pothole Detection and Analysis:

This project was presented in Mastek and Majesco's DeepBlue Season-4 Semi-Final round as well as for final TE project.
The project has 2 modules which is an android application and a web application.
The android application lets the user report the potholes in and around their areas and gives the parameters and severity of the pothole in turn.
The web application detects whether the query generated by user contains a pothole or not. The entry will be deleted if it does not contain any pothole. The web application will only be used by the admin.
